cy.navigateToQuizzes()              // Navigate to quiz selector
cy.navigateToGamification()         // Navigate to gamification dashboard
cy.navigateToAnalytics()            // Navigate to analytics dashboard
```

## Running Tests

### Prerequisites
```bash
# Ensure Laravel server is running
php artisan serve --host=0.0.0.0 --port=8000

# Ensure database is seeded with test data
php artisan db:seed
```

### Test Execution Commands

```bash
# Run all E2E tests (headless)
npm run e2e

# Open Cypress Test Runner (interactive)
npm run e2e:open

# Run specific test file
npx cypress run --spec cypress/e2e/01-authentication.cy.js

# Run tests with specific browser
npx cypress run --browser chrome

# Run tests in headed mode
npx cypress run --headed
```

### Test Environment Configuration

**Base URL:** `http://localhost:8000`
**Viewport:** 1280x720 (configurable)
**Timeout:** 10 seconds (global default)

## Test Data and Fixtures

```javascript
cy.mockApiResponse('GET', '/api/public/courses', { fixture: 'courses.json' })
```

## Continuous Integration

### GitHub Actions Integration
```yaml
- name: Run E2E Tests
  run: |
    npm install
    npm run build
    php artisan serve &
    npm run e2e
```

### Test Reporting
- Screenshots on test failure
- Video recordings of test runs
- Performance metrics collection
- Accessibility audit results

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues
1. **Test Timeouts**: Increase timeout for slow API responses
2. **Element Not Found**: Use proper data-testid attributes
3. **Flaky Tests**: Add appropriate wait conditions
4. **Authentication Issues**: Ensure proper session management

### Debug Mode
```bash
# Run tests with debug information
DEBUG=cypress:* npm run e2e:open
```

## Best Practices

### Test Writing Guidelines
1. Use descriptive test names
2. Follow AAA pattern (Arrange, Act, Assert)
3. Use data-testid attributes for element selection
4. Implement proper error handling
5. Keep tests independent and atomic

### Performance Considerations
1. Use cy.intercept() for API mocking
2. Minimize test data setup
3. Use beforeEach() for common setup
4. Clean up test data after completion

## Future Enhancements

### Planned Additions
- Visual regression testing
- Cross-browser test matrix
- Performance regression detection
- Automated accessibility auditing
- Load testing integration

### Test Automation Pipeline
- Pre-commit test hooks
